# Victorian Plumbing Listing page

This is a remake of a listing page from victorian Plumbing, which I completed as part of an internship with the Company. 
The page was made using React.js and during my time with the company, I learned how to used styled components, which is a form of CSS in JavaScript, to style the page.
I integrated dynamic data from the company's POST-endpoint API and manipulated this data to work with filters and facets, allowing me ti implement sorting, filtering, and pagination.
